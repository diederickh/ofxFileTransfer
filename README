ofxFileTransfer
===============
Addon created as an addon for openFrameworks which allows you to easily 
transfer files from "ofxFileTransferClients" to "ofxFileTransferServers".
You can use the ofxFileTransfer[Client|Server] for simple one-to-one
file transfers, or use the ofxFileTransferManager class to send multiple
files.

The ofxSync* classes form the basis to keep multiple remote clients in
sync.
